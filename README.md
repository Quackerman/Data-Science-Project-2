# Data-Science-Project-2
In Project 2, I web scrape a website of D&amp;D Monsters and analyze the monster data.
I wanted to learn more about some of the attributes that monsters had in D&D, and what was most common.
The files in this repo include:
Monster Web Scraping - a python jupyter notebook file where I scraped, cleaned, and analyzed the data
MonsterData.csv - a file contained all webscraped data from the Hypertext d20 SRD

All information sourced can be found at this website: https://5e.d20srd.org/indexes/monsters.htm
